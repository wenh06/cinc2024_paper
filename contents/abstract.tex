Aim: This paper addresses the challenge of simultaneous digitization and arrhythmia classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) captured from images or paper printouts, as presented by the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2024.

Methods: We propose a multi-stage framework to digitize and classify ECG images concurrently. The framework consists of 3 modules: (1) Region of Interest (ROI) extraction, (2) Arrhythmia classification, and (3) ECG waveform digitization. The ROI extraction module uses object detection to locate the ECG region in the image. We employ a DETR model with a ResNet-50 backbone to detect the ECG region. The arrhythmia classification module uses a light-weight ConvNeXt model to classify the ECG signal. The ECG waveform digitization module uses a U-Net model to extract the ECG waveform from the image. The digitization task envolves a highly unbalanced segmentation problem, where the ECG waveform occupies a small portion of the image. We propose a novel loss function to address this issue.

Results: Our team (''Revenger'') achieved a score of 0.33 for the classification problem on the hidden validation set, ranked 37/77; and SNR of -0.733 for the digitization problem, ranked 37/71.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of digitizing and classifying ECG images concurrently, but needs further improvement to achieve better performance.
